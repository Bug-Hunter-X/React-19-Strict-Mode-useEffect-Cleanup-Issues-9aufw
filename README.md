# React 19 Strict Mode useEffect Cleanup Bug

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with `useEffect` cleanup functions in React 19's strict mode.  The problem is that the cleanup function may execute more times than expected, or it might not run at all under certain conditions.

## Problem

The bug is related to how strict mode handles state updates and component re-renders.  This can lead to unexpected behavior in cleanup functions, potentially leading to memory leaks or other issues.

## Solution

The provided solution carefully manages the cleanup logic by checking if the cleanup function is still necessary before proceeding with its execution. This minimizes potential errors.   Further improvements to reduce rerenders or more sophisticated state management strategies can be necessary in more complex scenarios.
